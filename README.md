#### Description:
Kanban board with a persistent database and userbase. Add tasks and manage your projects properly!

This project was part of Introduction to software engineering course. The focus of this project was working as a team of 3, managing the project via github and implementing a 4 tier architecture project.

#### Description:
CLI based DND game! The whole board is a matrix of chars, the player is marked with '@', '.' are empty tiles and '#' are walls (enemies are any other char!). Each time the player gives an input, a game tick happens, where enemies get to play a turn!

This project was part of principles of object oriented programming course. The project focused on OOP principles and uses various design patterns: visitor pattern, factory, singleton, obeserver and a few more.
